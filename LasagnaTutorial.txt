Step 1:
Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat
Step 2:
In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
Step 3:
Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more. Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.
Step 4:
Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.
Step 5:
Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.
Step 6:
Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer.  Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.
Step 7:
By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions
Step 8:
Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.
Step 9:
When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.
Step 10:
Heat the oven to 375Â°F/190,556 celcius.
Step 11:
Add the lasagna, sauce, mozerella in that order until the tray is covered.
Step 12:
Bake for 45 minutes and enjoy.
